COVID-19 Data (Two Table) Exploration & Analysis with SQL

1-CovidDeaths$
2-CovidVaccinations$

Overview:
This project involved comprehensive exploration and analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL Server. The dataset included information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights from raw pandemic data and prepare it for potential visualization and dashboarding.

Key Features & Contributions:

‚úÖ Data Cleaning & Filtering:

Removed null and irrelevant entries for accurate analysis.

Filtered data to focus on continents and countries for deeper geographic insights.

üìà Descriptive Statistical Analysis:

Calculated death rate per case to understand fatality trends.

Computed infection percentage of total population by country.

Identified countries and continents with highest death counts and infection rates.

üåç Global Summary Metrics:

Summed up global daily new cases and deaths.

Calculated the global death percentage over time.

üíâ Vaccination Analysis:

Joined death and vaccination datasets to correlate vaccination rollout with infection trends.

Created rolling sum metrics using WINDOW FUNCTIONS for total vaccinations per location.

Applied Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temporary Tables to structure complex logic and support reusability.

Tools & Techniques Used:

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SQL features: JOIN, GROUP BY, CTE, TEMP TABLE, VIEWS, WINDOW FUNCTIONS.
